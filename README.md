# About Cursedscript

Cursedscript is a very high-level programming language made using python. Cursedscript can perform simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. You can even set priorities to your operations using small brackets. The variables can only store numbers and floating points. The “craft” keyword is used to create new variables. The variables are stored in the form of dictionary.

# How to use?
